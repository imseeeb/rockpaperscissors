# ROCK | PAPER | SCISSORS
*(real hand edition)*

As a form of practice I've added very unnecessary controls to a really simple game.

You can play a classic rock/paper/scissors against computer by actually forming the figures with the in-game hand.

## Info
- pure javascript
- you can grab the fingertips to move the fingers around
- fingers are generated with svg lines
- there are limitations on finger's movement (so that you can't break those virtual fingers while playing)
- opponent's moves are random generated
- hands' position adjusts with different screen size
- in case of buggy graphics just reload the page (svg seems to behave quite funny when dynamically generated and moved around)
- might not work well on small mobile screens (it's hard to fit movable fingers in such small space)
